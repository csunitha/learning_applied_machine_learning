# A repository to capture Applied ML learning journey 
## Daily Progress 

### Day 2
Started the Intro to ML course in Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
Learnt the following through analyzing Melbourne and Iowa housing data. Lessons 1-3
- Opening a csv file and loading into data frame -> pd.read_csv(filepath)
- List out the columns -> df.columns
- Describe and get the values - count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max -> df.describe(). df[['col1','col3']].describe()

Also learnt to select prediction target(y) and features(X) that would be used for prediction 
example 
y = df.colname
X = df['col1', 'col2', 'col5']

Also read about standard deviation (population and sample), Ïƒ from awesome link https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html

Also trying my hand with getting a fair understanding of git branching and commit. 

### Day 1
Finished the python course in Kaggle and tried first exercise of titanic survival prediction in kaggle tutorial. Along with that, did the same code in my local vscode.
Day1 is 3-Jul-2021.
