# Summary of items worth reminding

#### DataFrame
A dataframe is datastructure in Pandas that holds the type of data you might think as a table. 

#### Features 
The columns that are inputted to our model and later used to make predictions are called *features*. Sometimes you will use all the columns except target as features. Othertimes you will be better off with fewer features.

#### Fitting / Training a model 
Capturing patterns from data is caled *fitting* or *training the model*. The data used to fit the model is called the *training data*

#### Kaggle - Getting started with a machine learning competition 
Initial steps to predict
- Understand the problem
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train, tune & Ensemble ML models 
- Predict & receive accuracy score

Further steps to improve score 
- Learn more about data
- Experiment
    - Design / create some new features
    - Try different preprocessing 
    - Try different types of ML models
    - Combine multiple models (Ensemble)
- Learn from others code and ideas

#### Pandas
Pandas is the primary tool data scientist use for exploring and manipulating data 

#### skikit-learn
scikit-learn is easily the most popular library for modelling the types of data typically stored in DataFrames.

#### Steps in building and using a model
- Define - the type of model to be used 
- Fit - capture patterns from provided data. This is the *heart* of modelling
- Predict
- Evaluate - determine the accuracy of model's prediction
